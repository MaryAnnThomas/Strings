  1)Immutable String in Java

In java, string objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.

Once string object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new string object is created.

There are three ways to compare string in java:
By equals() method
By = = operator
By compareTo() method

A part of string is called substring. In other words, substring is a subset of another string. In case of substring startIndex is inclusive and endIndex is exclusive.
In case of string:

startIndex: inclusive
endIndex: exclusive
